SCSS Scaffold Patterns
======================

Organize bits and snippets here for easy access. All parts (HTML/SCSS/JS) should be present when needed. 

In each SCSS, place comments as to the Use Case. Explain as thoroughly as possible. Provide sample markup right in the SCSS. If JS is needed, add it alongside in another file (same name, different extension). List any library or plugin dependencies. 

Keep it clean and neat, and keep large patterns out of the Scaffold. 

These should be easy to implement, with a little effort.
